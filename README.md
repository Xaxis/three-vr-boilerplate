# three-vr-boilerplate

## Summary

Scaffolding for rapidly building Three.js/WebVR based applications.

Recently while experimenting with Three.js and WebVR (using [webvr-boilerplate](https://github.com/borismus/webvr-boilerplate)) I realized I 
needed a faster way to get started developing. One day WebVR applications will be more than fun demos. They will be 
major applications that sit upon modern MVC architectures requiring sophisticated dependency management. This project is
an attempt at answering that problem.

## Features

* Prescriptive yet flexible (scalable) directory structure scaffolding
* webvr-boilerplate and Three.js integration
* Require.js integration/module template example
* Backbone MVC module pattern/module template example
* Grunt automation and SASS compilation
